# `paftools` Tutorial

**This tutorial is in initial stages of construction**

## Introduction

`paftools` is a command line application providing tools for
processing data generated by the [Plant and Fungal Trees of Life
(PAFTOL) project](https://www.paftol.org/). These tools range from
simple utilities to specialised integrated analysis "pipelines" of
considerable complexity.

There is only one shell command, `paftools`, that provides access to
all the tools. The first free parameter to the `paftools` command
specifies the tool to be used.

Throughout paftools, the `-h` option provides help. Specifically,
* `paftools -h` shows help about using the `paftools` command, including a list of all tools (i.e. subcommands),
* `paftools <cmd> -h` shows help about the tool `<cmd>`.

Try running
```
paftools -h
```
and then use `-h` on a specific command you have found. Share one
question you have about what you've found (e.g. by sending an email
to the PAFTOL data analysis team, or by discussing with your neighbour
in a training session).


## Practical Preparation

Please install [Docker](https://www.docker.com), and familiarise
yourself with
* running a container using the `docker run -t -i` command,
* downloading a container image using the `docker pull` command,
* bind-mounting a directory on your host system using the `--mount type=bind,src=...,dst=...` option to the `docker run` command.

## Architecture and Design

`paftools` is essentially a command line interface (CLI) to the Python
module `paftol`. This module provides an Application Programming
Interface (API) of classes designed to formally model concepts
relevant to PAFTOL data analysis. Currently, these are mainly centred
around recovery of target sequences. Additionally, there is support
for phylogeny inference, which however is not as complete at this
time.

**Orthogonality** is a key principle underpinning and guiding the
design `paftol` API and of `paftools`. This means tha
