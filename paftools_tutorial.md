# `paftools` Tutorial

**This tutorial is in initial stages of construction**

## Introduction

`paftools` is a command line application providing tools for
processing data generated by the [Plant and Fungal Trees of Life
(PAFTOL) project](https://www.paftol.org/). These tools range from
simple utilities to specialised integrated analysis "pipelines" of
considerable complexity.

There is only one shell command, `paftools`, that provides access to
all the tools. The first free parameter to the `paftools` command
specifies the tool to be used.

Throughout paftools, the `-h` option provides help. Specifically,
* `paftools -h` shows help about using the `paftools` command, including a list of all tools (i.e. subcommands),
* `paftools <cmd> -h` shows help about the tool `<cmd>`.

Try running
```
paftools -h
```
and then use `-h` on a specific command you have found. Share one
question you have about what you've found (e.g. by sending an email
to the PAFTOL data analysis team, or by discussing with your neighbour
in a training session).
