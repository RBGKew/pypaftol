# `paftools` Tutorial

**This tutorial is in initial stages of construction**

## Introduction

`paftools` is a command line application providing tools for
processing data generated by the [Plant and Fungal Trees of Life
(PAFTOL) project](https://www.paftol.org/). These tools range from
simple utilities to specialised integrated analysis "pipelines" of
considerable complexity.

There is only one shell command, `paftools`, that provides access to
all the tools. The first free parameter to the `paftools` command
specifies the tool to be used.

Throughout paftools, the `-h` option provides help. Specifically,
* `paftools -h` shows help about using the `paftools` command, including a list of all tools (i.e. subcommands),
* `paftools /cmd/ -h` shows help about the tool `/cmd/`.
